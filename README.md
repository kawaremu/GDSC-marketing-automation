In order to reach GDSC member is a more efficient way, I decided to contribute to this project by writting a script based app to automate the process.

Given a ``.csv`` file and a template mail, the script will send a mail to each concerned person.

# âœ… To-do list

- [ ] regex on the template mail
- [ ] layout with HTML & CSS : button to import csv file, input for Object of the email, input for text
- [ ] get column from csv file
- [ ] get key for Gmail API
- [ ] send dummy emails
